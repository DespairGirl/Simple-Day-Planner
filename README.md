# Simple-Day-Planner
This Day Planner is a simple web application that allows user to input and save daily tasks. With the use of jQuery to dynamically update HTML and CSS, the user will be able to visualize their daily schedule in a more organized way, as the time blocks change colours based on what the current time is-- different colors for past, present, and future times.
